# 1. Execute the following file in Jupyter notebook where the cleaned data set is kept:

Online_Retail_Data_Cleaning.ipynb

# 2. One output file will be generated, which is 'Online_Reatil_Data.csv'. This csv file needs to be imported in MongoDB odb.


# Steps to import csv to MongoDB to ODB
# 1. Go to the terminal and login to MongoDB (by typing ‘mongo’ to stay in the same terminal or ‘mongod’ to switch to a new terminal).
# (Pre-requisite: Prior installation of MongoDB in the system and the mongodb service to be running.)
# 2. Switch to or create a new database – ‘odb’ in MongoDB with the help of the following command in the terminal:

use odb

# 3. In a separate terminal, navigate to the path where the cleaned data file is present. The MongoDB import command is executed outside the mongo shell - in a normal terminal, with the help of the following command:

mongoimport --db odb --collection retail --type csv --headerline --file Online_Retail_Data.csv

# Steps to import data from ODB to ADB

# Switch to adb database:

use adb

# Execute the scripts in the following files:
# 1. customer_dim_insert_script
# 2. stock_dim_insert_script
# 3. time_dim_insert_script
# 4. fact_collection_insert_script
