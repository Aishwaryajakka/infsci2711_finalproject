# Steps followed to clean the Cleaned2009-2010.xlsx and Cleaned 2010-2011.xlsx. (actual data files) from the data folder:
# 1. Changed the file type to csv.
# 2. Loaded the csv files to Jupyter Notebook (Python) and converted them to dataframes.
# 3. Concatenated two dataframes using the ‘append’ function.
# 4. The attribute ‘Customer ID’ is renames to ‘CustomerID’.
# 5. The attributes ‘InvoiveDate’ and ‘InvoiceTime’ are then concatenated and renamed to ‘InvoiceDateTime’. Later, they are split to Year (YYYY), Month (MM), Day (DD), Hour (HH) and Minute (MM).
# 6. The dataframe is then exported to the data folder as ‘Online_Retail_DB.csv’. 

# Steps to import csv to MongoDB to ODB
# 1. Go to the terminal and login to MongoDB (by typing ‘mongo’ to stay in the same terminal or ‘mongod’ to switch to a new terminal).
# (Pre-requisite: Prior installation of MongoDB in the system and the mongodb service to be running.)
# 2. Switch to or create a new database – ‘odb’ in MongoDB with the help of the following command in the terminal:

use odb

# 3. In a separate terminal, navigate to the path where the cleaned data file is present. The MongoDB import command is executed outside the mongo shell - in a normal terminal, with the help of the following command:

mongoimport --db odb --collection retail --type csv --headerline --file Online_Retail_Data.csv

# Steps to import data from ODB to ADB

# Switch to adb database:

use adb

# Execute the scripts in the following files:
# 1. customer_dim_insert_script
# 2. stock_dim_insert_script
# 3. time_dim_insert_script
# 4. fact_collection_insert_script
