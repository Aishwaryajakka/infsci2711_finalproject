**This query converts the information in InvoiceTime in the ODB and converts it into a format understood by neo4j. This will make it easier to seperate into hour, minute and second
**This can be done using InvoiceTime.hour, InvoiceTime.minute, InvoiceTime.second
**In order to run this query you will need to change the skip and limit paramerters
