//You will need to install the APOC plugin 
//Adjust the batchSize according to your computer
//This query converts the information in InvoiceTime in the ODB and converts it into a format understood by neo4j. This will make it easier to seperate into hour, minute and second
//This can be done using InvoiceTime.hour, InvoiceTime.minute, InvoiceTime.second
